Docker containers run from an Ubuntu base and are executed like processes but remain isolated from the host.

Containers differ from VMs because, instead of virtualizing hardware, they share the host OS kernel and isolate:

IP addresses

Ports & sockets

Network stack

Process space

File system space

Hostname space

User space

A Docker container runs within the host machine and exposes ports (e.g., container port 80 → host port 8080).

Containers are ephemeral—they can be created, destroyed, and recreated easily, which is why data inside them can disappear unless volumes are used.

VMs are hypervisor-based, whereas containers rely on OS-level virtualization and are much lighter.

Networking involves concepts like Ethernet cables, IPs, switches, gateways, and subnetting.

docker run ubuntu
docker run -it ubuntu bash      # Run with interactive shell
docker run -d nginx             # Run in background


docker stop <container_id>
docker start <container_id>
docker rm <container_id>
docker rmi <image_id>
