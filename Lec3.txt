Continuous Delivery (CD)
Definition

CD starts where CI (Continuous Integration) ends.

The goal is to automate deployment of tested artifacts to various environments, ensuring faster, reliable releases.

Flow of Environments
SIT  →  UAT  →  Pre-Prod  →  Production


SIT (System Integration Testing): Checks whether all integrated modules work together.

UAT (User Acceptance Testing): Final testing done by end-users before production.

Pre-Prod: Final staging environment mirroring production.

Prod: Actual live system.

Testing in CD
Type	Purpose	Example
Functional Testing	Verifies business logic	Testing login, signup, etc.
Performance Testing	Ensures system can handle load	Using JMeter
Security Testing (DAST)	Dynamic checks on running app	OWASP ZAP, Burp Suite
Continuous Deployment

Extends CD — after successful validation, deployment is automatic to production (no manual approval).

Ensures Zero Downtime Deployment (ZDD) or Blue-Green Deployment.

Testing & Quality Metrics

Code Coverage: ~80% recommended

Types: Line Coverage, Function Coverage, Branch Coverage

Mocking: Used for unit test isolation

Cyclomatic Complexity: Measures code complexity (analyzed by SonarQube)

Defect Categories: Critical, Blockers, Code Smells

Linux Basics

Created by Linus Torvalds (1991)

Open-source, used in ~90% of production environments

200+ distributions (Ubuntu, Red Hat, CentOS, etc.)

Kernel

Core of the OS – interface between hardware and software

Manages CPU, memory, and hardware resources

Microkernel Architecture: minimal kernel handling essential tasks; drivers handled separately.

AWS – EC2 & Networking
EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)

Creates virtual machines in AWS.

AMIs (Amazon Machine Images): pre-configured templates (OS + software).

Users can also create custom AMIs.

VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

Private virtual network within AWS.

Contains subnets (Public/Private).

Connected to the internet via IGW (Internet Gateway).

Ensures layered security at multiple levels.

IP Types
Type	Description
Public IP	Internet-accessible, changes when instance restarts
Private IP	Internal AWS communication
Elastic IP	Static, persistent public IP
