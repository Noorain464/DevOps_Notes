Docker Image

A Docker Image is the blueprint of a container — it contains everything needed to run an application (code, libraries, dependencies, etc.).

Images are immutable and portable, ensuring consistent environments across systems.

Base Image

The foundation layer for your image (e.g., ubuntu, python).

Custom images are built on top of base images.

Dockerfile

A Dockerfile is a script that contains instructions to build a Docker image.

Each instruction in the Dockerfile creates a new layer in the image.

Common instructions:

FROM → Defines the base image.

RUN → Executes commands inside the image (e.g., RUN echo "Hello World").

COPY / ADD → Copy files or directories into the image.

CMD → Specifies the default command to run when the container starts.

ENTRYPOINT → Defines a command that will always run, even if parameters are passed.

Building and Running Docker Images

Build an image:

docker build -t <image_name> .


-t → tag (assigns a name to your image)

. → current directory (location of Dockerfile)

Run a container:

docker run <image_name>


Example:

docker build -t myapp .
docker run myapp

Key Concepts

Container: A running instance of a Docker image.

Portability: Docker images can run anywhere, making them platform-independent.

Layers: Each Dockerfile instruction adds a new layer, making images more efficient (shared layers are cached).

CMD vs ENTRYPOINT
Command	Purpose	Behavior
CMD	- Provides default command/arguments. Can be overridden when running the container
ENTRYPOINT - Defines the executable that always runs. Cannot be overridden by command-line arguments (unless specified)
