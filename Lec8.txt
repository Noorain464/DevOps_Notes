Docker volumes are used to persist data even if a container is deleted.

Similar to using a USB drive for containers—data stays safe outside the container.

Types of storage:

tmpfs

Only on Linux

Stored in RAM

Very fast but temporary (vanishes when container stops)

Bind mounts

Maps a host directory directly into a container

Volumes (most commonly used)

Stored under /var/lib/docker/volumes

Managed by Docker

Types of Docker Volumes

Named Volumes

Created and managed with a name

Recommended for most use cases

Anonymous Volumes

Created automatically when no name is provided

Hard to track/manage

Volume Behavior

If files are created on the host, they appear inside the container.

If files are created inside the container, they appear on the host volume.

Thus, both sides sync instantly in real-time.

Multiple containers can share the same volume → they can talk / sync data in real time.

 Important Docker Volume Commands
1. Create a volume
docker volume create myvolume

2. List volumes
docker volume ls

3. Inspect a volume
docker volume inspect myvolume

4. Remove a volume
docker volume rm myvolume

Run Container with Volume Attached
Named Volume
docker run -v myvolume:/data ubuntu

Anonymous Volume
docker run -v /data ubuntu

Bind Mount (host folder mapped to container folder)
docker run -v /home/user/app:/app ubuntu

tmpfs Mount (Linux only)
docker run --tmpfs /app tmpfs ubuntu

Sharing a Volume Between Two Containers
docker run -v sharedvol:/data --name c1 ubuntu
docker run -v sharedvol:/data --name c2 ubuntu


Both containers now share /data and can exchange data instantly.
